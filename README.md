## How We Built It

DeisQuest was developed using a robust stack of technologies to ensure a smooth and engaging user experience. The core components include:

- **Flask:** We utilized Flask for backend routing, taking advantage of its lightweight and efficient framework to handle user requests and server responses.
- **Cookies:** User-specific data, such as the assistant thread ID and authentication details, are managed through cookies to maintain a seamless user experience across sessions.
- **Jinja and Bootstrap:** The frontend is crafted with Jinja and Bootstrap, balancing aesthetics and functionality. This combination allowed us to create a user-friendly interface that is both responsive and intuitive.
- **PostgreSQL:** For our database needs, we chose PostgreSQL. Its reliability and robust features support our complex data management requirements, ensuring secure and efficient data handling.

## Challenges We Ran Into

Developing DeisQuest within a limited timeframe posed several challenges:

- **Time Constraints:** The biggest challenge was the time restriction. Crafting a fully-featured application in such a short period was ambitious.
- **Feature Prioritization:** Deciding which features to prioritize for the minimal viable product (MVP) was critical. We aimed to showcase the core functionalities while ensuring a stable and user-friendly experience.
- **Integration of Technologies:** Seamlessly integrating different technologies (Flask, PostgreSQL, Jinja, Bootstrap) within a tight schedule was a demanding task that required careful planning and execution.

## Accomplishments That We're Proud Of

- **Successful MVP Development:** We are proud of developing a functional MVP that not only meets the basic requirements but also includes features that we initially thought were beyond our scope for this phase.
- **Effective Teamwork:** Our team's ability to collaborate efficiently and overcome challenges together was key to our success.
- **Positive User Feedback:** Receiving encouraging feedback from initial users has been highly rewarding, affirming the value and potential of DeisQuest.

## What We Learned

- **Rapid Development Techniques:** We've gained invaluable experience in developing a product under time pressure, learning to prioritize features and make effective use of our resources.
- **The Power of Collaboration:** This project underscored the importance of teamwork and communication in overcoming technical and logistical hurdles.
- **User-Centric Design:** Focusing on the user experience from the start helped us create an application that is not only functional but also engaging and easy to use.

## What's Next for DeisQuest

Looking ahead, we have several exciting plans for DeisQuest:

- **Feature Expansion:** We plan to expand the range of quests and rewards, enhancing the educational and gamified experience.
